#===============================================================
# Some of the files we source will sub-source files in their
# own sub-folders, and will do so with paths that are hard
# as relative sub-paths. To make this work the files that
# we source will need to be told where they are. We do this
# my passing the sourced file it's own path as a first arg
# like so:
#
#    source <absolutepath>/to/file <absolutepath>/to/file
#
# But we wrap this ugliness in a function '_source', hence
#
#    _source <absolutepath>/to/file
#
# Since the sourced file receives it's own path, it can
# source its own subfiles by
#
#    _source $(dirname $1)/path/to/subfile
#

function __source__ {
    # Source a file with its own name so it knows where it is.
    #
    source $1 $1
}
