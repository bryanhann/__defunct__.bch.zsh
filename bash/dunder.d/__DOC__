#===============================================================
# Suppose we want to internally document a function in a
# way that can be inspected at runtime. We do this with the
# function '__DOC__'.
#
#     function foo {
#         __DOC__ 'foo() -> bar'
#         ....
#
# We can later review this by grepping the environment:
#
#     set | grep __DOC__
#
# Note that while the function itself does nothing, by
# prepending it to a line of documentation that line
# is registered in the environment.
#
# TODO (maybe): implement intelligent registration
#

function __DOC__ {
    # Do nothing but consume its arguments
    #
    true
}
